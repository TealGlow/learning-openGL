# OpenGL Learning

This github repo contains all my files from me learning OpenGL.  Most of the code provided is directly adapted from the openGL learning resource found here: https://learnopengl.com/

Everything has been adapted to be in the C programming language.  As I am reading, and working along with the textbook more will be added.


### Updated as I work through the textbook :)
